Your program has to take as parameter a map description file ending with the .ber
extension.
• The map can be composed of only these 5 characters:
0 for an empty space,
1 for a wall,
C for a collectible,
E for a map exit,
P for the player’s starting position.
map1.ber is a simple valid map
The map must contain at least 1 exit, 1 collectible, and 1 starting position.
• The map must be rectangular.
• The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. If it’s not, the program must return
an error.
